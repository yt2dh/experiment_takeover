    <p><b>Main Task</b></p>

    <p><u>Roles and Groups</u></p>

    <ul>
        <li>At the beginning of each round, you will be randomly assigned one of two roles: <b>buyer or seller</b>, with equal probability. You may be in a <b>different role</b> from one round to the next.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>In each round, a buyer will be randomly paired with a seller to take part in the sale of an asset. Your earnings in a round depend on the decisions made by you and the participant you are paired with, as well as chance. At the start of each round, you will be randomly paired with a participant, so the participant you are paired with may be different in each round.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u>Buyer's Decision</u></p>

    <ul>
        <li>In each round, the buyer will receive an endowment to bid for an asset of unknown value. The endowment does not count towards the earnings and will be reset in each round.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>The buyer will make a bid to the seller by entering their bid through the computer and click on “Next” to confirm their bid.</li>
    </ul>

     <p><u>Seller's Decision</u></p>

    <ul>
        <li>In each round, the seller will receive an asset of unknown value. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>The seller will decide whether to accept or reject the buyer’s bid and click on “Next” to confirm their choice.</li>
    </ul>
